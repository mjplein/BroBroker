            <p style="font-size:50%;">*BroBroker does not use any logic or algorithm systems in determining matches. In lieu of efficient and effective data processing/analyzing systems, BroBroker utilizes a highly untrained team of grossly overpaid, severely under-qualified, dangerously uneducated, criminally unambitious and unmotivated individuals. These individuals (after putting in almost no effort or as little effort as possible) will discard any and all collected data from surveys and return matches via unknown methods.</p>
            <p style="font-size:50%;">BroBroker is not liable or responsible for poorly matched bros.</p>
